I recently read a brief history of humanity written by Yuval Noah Hariari, which outlines four aspects, namely human cognition, agricultural revolution, the modernization of the country from regional to global Development, and the great social changes brought about by the scientific revolution. 

In this process, I saw that the formation of human society is inseparable from the common imagination that exists in human consciousness. Because humans trust certain things together, hundreds of millions of humans can work together. The imagination of human trust includes human Economic, political, religious, etc.
